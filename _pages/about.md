I am a postdoctoral researcher at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC) hosted by [Prof. Avrim Blum](https://home.ttic.edu/~avrim/). Currently, I am supported by [Simons Collaboration on the Theory of Algorithmic Fairness](https://toc4fairness.org/). Prior to joining TTIC I did my PhD at University of Maryland College Park where I was advised by [Prof. Samir Khuller](http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/samir/). I am interested in machine learning (mostly adversarial learning and learning in the presence of strategic behavior), algorithmic fairness, and theoretical computer science.
